// Find the Missing Number 

// The following was a question that I received during a technical interview for an entry level software developer position. I thought I'd post it here so that everyone could give it a go:

// You are given an unsorted array containing all the integers from 0 to 100 inclusively. However, one number is missing. Write a function to find and return this number.



missingNo = (n) => {
    for (i=0;i<=100;i++){
        if(!n.includes(i)){
            return i
        }}};

/* P: Parameters: numbers from 0 to 100; question does not mention input as a string. 

R: Result: single +number that is missing from 0-100

E: Example: [9, 45, 53, 10, 100, 30, 85, 72, 69, 93, 98, 27, 73, 82, 91, 60, 5, 79, 88, 18, 71, 36, 44, 22, 89, 40, 59, 80, 81, 67, 25, 54, 13, 64, 56, 39, 48, 92, 84, 94, 87, 90, 77, 63, 32, 68, 37, 96, 23, 0, 95, 1, 52, 78, 6, 57, 50, 2, 46, 19, 76, 47, 14, 4, 3, 29, 17, 11, 21, 24, 74, 65, 12, 83, 28, 41, 66, 7, 58, 55, 51, 43, 97, 42, 86, 49, 31, 20, 75, 70, 34, 33, 38, 8, 15, 62, 35, 61, 99, 16] // 26 is the answer //

P: Pseudo code: 

Need to iterate over inputted array with limit at 100
- Conditional: if array does not include number from 0-100 
return that number
