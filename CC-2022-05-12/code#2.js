// Difference of Volumes of Cuboids

// In this simple exercise, you will create a program that will take two lists of integers, a and b. Each list will consist of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids a and b. You must find the difference of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.

// For example, if the parameters passed are ([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1]), the volume of a is 12 and the volume of b is 20. Therefore, the function should return 8.

// Your function will be tested with pre-made examples as well as random ones.

function findDifference(a, b) {
    let aVol = a.reduce(((acc, ele) => acc *= ele), 1);
    let bVol = b.reduce(((acc, ele) => acc *= ele), 1);
    return Math.abs(aVol - bVol);
  }
